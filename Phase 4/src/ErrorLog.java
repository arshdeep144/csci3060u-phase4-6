/*
    The ErrorLog program creates a log containing information on errors that
    occur when processing transactions. The two types of errors that it records are
    failed constraint errors and fatal errors. Failed constraint errors should
    log a message containing the type and description of the failed tranaction.
    Fatal errors should log a message containing the type and description
    of the file that caused the failure.
